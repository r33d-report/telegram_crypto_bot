## BTCC API

### BTCC Authentication Methods and Security

BTCC employs HMAC-based authentication for secure API access:

1. **API Key Generation**:
   - Users can create up to 5 API keys through the BTCC web portal
   - Each key can have configurable permissions (read and/or trade)
   - Keys can be bound to up to 5 IP addresses for enhanced security

2. **HMAC Authentication Process**:
   - Uses a shared secret key with hash functions (typically SHA-256)
   - Signature generation involves creating a hash of specific request components:
     - HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
     - Full URL (including query parameters)
     - Timestamp (to prevent replay attacks)
     - Request body (if applicable)

3. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Secret keys should never be transmitted over the network
   - Timestamp synchronization between client and server is crucial
   - IP restrictions add an additional layer of security
   - Proper error handling for signature validation issues

### BTCC Available Endpoints for Trading

BTCC offers comprehensive API endpoints for various trading functionalities:

1. **Spot Trading**:

   - Order cancellation and replacement
   - Order status querying

2. **Futures Trading**:
   - USDT-M and Coin-M perpetual futures contracts
   - Specialized endpoints for futures trading operations
   - Position management

3. **Market Data**:
   - OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) price data
   - Order book depth information
   - Trade history
   - Real-time market data via WebSocket

4. **Account Management**:
   - Account balance retrieval
   - Position information
   - Risk profile data
   - Trade execution reports and transaction history

5. **WebSocket API**:
   - Real-time market data streams
   - Channels for active contracts, quotes, order updates

### BTCC Rate Limits and Constraints

BTCC enforces specific rate limits to ensure fair usage and platform stability:

| Endpoint Type | Limit | Period | Policy |
|---------------|-------|--------|--------|
| Balance | 120 requests | 60 seconds | IP-based |
| Order (POST) | 300 requests | 60 seconds | Account & IP |
| Order (DELETE) | 300 requests | 60 seconds | Account & IP |
| Order (GET) | 900 requests | 60 seconds | Account & IP |
| Open Orders | 300 requests | 60 seconds | IP-based |
| All Orders | 300 requests | 60 seconds | IP-based |
| Trades | 90 requests | 60 seconds | IP-based |
| User Transactions | 120 requests | 60 seconds | IP-based |
| Crypto Transactions | 90 requests | 60 seconds | IP-based |
