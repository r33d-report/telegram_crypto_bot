## Security Best Practices

Securing your crypto trading bot is crucial since it handles financial transactions and API keys.

### Protect Your API Keys

1. **Never store API keys directly in your code**
   - Use environment variables or a .env file as shown above
   - Make sure your .env file is not tracked in git (add it to .gitignore)

2. **Set proper file permissions**
   ```bash
   chmod 600 .env  # Only the owner can read and write
   ```

3. **Use read-only API keys when possible**
   - For price alerts and monitoring, you don't need trading permissions
   - Only use trading-enabled API keys for the actual trading functions

4. **IP restrictions**
   - If your exchange supports it, restrict API access to your server's IP address

### Secure Your Server

1. **Update regularly**
   ```bash
   apt update && apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Set up a firewall**
   ```bash
   # Install UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
   apt install ufw
   
   # Allow SSH connections
   ufw allow ssh
   
   # Enable the firewall
   ufw enable
   ```

3. **Disable root SSH access**
   ```bash
   # Edit SSH configuration
   nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```
   
   Find and change:
   ```
   PermitRootLogin no
   ```
   
   Then restart SSH:
   ```bash
   systemctl restart sshd
   ```

4. **Set up fail2ban to prevent brute force attacks**
   ```bash
   apt install fail2ban
   systemctl enable fail2ban
   systemctl start fail2ban
   ```

### Secure Your Telegram Bot

1. **Use a bot token with restricted commands**
   - Create your bot through @BotFather
   - Only implement commands that are necessary

2. **Implement user authentication**
   - Restrict bot access to specific Telegram user IDs
   - Add a password or PIN for sensitive operations

3. **Add command confirmation**
   - Require confirmation for trading operations
   - Use inline keyboards for confirmation buttons

## Keeping Your Bot Running 24/7

There are several methods to ensure your bot runs continuously:

### Method 1: PM2 (Recommended)

PM2 is a process manager for Node.js applications but works well for Python scripts too:

```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start your bot
pm2 start "python3 /path/to/your/bot.py" --name crypto-telegram-bot

# Make PM2 start on system boot
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

PM2 Commands:
- Check status: `pm2 status`
- View logs: `pm2 logs crypto-telegram-bot`
- Restart bot: `pm2 restart crypto-telegram-bot`
- Stop bot: `pm2 stop crypto-telegram-bot`

### Method 2: Systemd Service

Create a systemd service file:

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/crypto-bot.service
```

Add the following content:

```
[Unit]
Description=Telegram Crypto Trading Bot
After=network.target

[Service]
User=botuser
WorkingDirectory=/opt/telegram-crypto-bot
ExecStart=/opt/telegram-crypto-bot/venv/bin/python3 bot.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=crypto-bot

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the service:

```bash
systemctl enable crypto-bot
systemctl start crypto-bot
```

Systemd Commands:
- Check status: `systemctl status crypto-bot`
- View logs: `journalctl -u crypto-bot`
- Restart bot: `systemctl restart crypto-bot`
- Stop bot: `systemctl stop crypto-bot`

### Method 3: Screen (Simple Fallback)

Screen allows you to run processes in the background:

```bash
# Install screen if not already installed
apt install screen

# Start a new screen session
screen -S crypto-bot

# Activate virtual environment
source /opt/telegram-crypto-bot/venv/bin/activate

# Start your bot
python3 /opt/telegram-crypto-bot/bot.py

# Detach from screen by pressing Ctrl+A, then D
```

Screen Commands:
- List sessions: `screen -ls`
- Reattach to session: `screen -r crypto-bot`
- Kill session: `screen -X -S crypto-bot quit`

## Handling Crashes and Restarts

### Automatic Restart with PM2

PM2 automatically restarts your bot if it crashes. You can configure additional restart behavior:

```bash
pm2 start "python3 bot.py" --name crypto-telegram-bot --max-memory-restart 500M
```

This will restart your bot if it uses more than 500MB of memory.

### Automatic Restart with Systemd

The `Restart=always` option in the systemd service file ensures your bot restarts if it crashes.

You can add more sophisticated restart policies:

```
RestartSec=10  # Wait 10 seconds before restarting
StartLimitIntervalSec=60  # 60-second interval
StartLimitBurst=5  # Allow 5 restarts in the interval
```

### Monitoring and Alerts

Set up monitoring to be notified of issues:

1. **Simple email alerts with Monit**:
   ```bash
   apt install monit
   
   # Configure monit
   nano /etc/monit/conf.d/crypto-bot
   ```
   
   Add:
   ```
   check process crypto-bot with pidfile /home/botuser/.pm2/pm2.pid
     start program = "/usr/bin/pm2 start crypto-telegram-bot"
     stop program = "/usr/bin/pm2 stop crypto-telegram-bot"
     if not exist then restart
     if 5 restarts within 5 cycles then alert
   ```

2. **Telegram notifications**:
   
   Create a simple notification script:
   ```bash
   nano /opt/telegram-crypto-bot/notify.py
   ```
   
   Add:
   ```python
   import requests
   import sys
   
   def send_telegram_message(bot_token, chat_id, message):
       url = f"https://api.telegram.org/bot{bot_token}/sendMessage"
       data = {
           "chat_id": chat_id,
           "text": message
       }
       requests.post(url, data=data)
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       bot_token = "YOUR_NOTIFICATION_BOT_TOKEN"  # Create a separate bot for notifications
       chat_id = "YOUR_CHAT_ID"  # Your personal chat ID
       message = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "Bot status notification"
       send_telegram_message(bot_token, chat_id, message)
   ```
   
   Add to your systemd service:
   ```
   ExecStartPost=/opt/telegram-crypto-bot/venv/bin/python3 /opt/telegram-crypto-bot/notify.py "Bot started"
   ExecStopPost=/opt/telegram-crypto-bot/venv/bin/python3 /opt/telegram-crypto-bot/notify.py "Bot stopped"
   ```

## Updating Your Bot

### Method 1: Manual Update

1. Stop your bot:
   ```bash
   # If using PM2
   pm2 stop crypto-telegram-bot
   
   # If using systemd

3. Update dependencies if needed:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Restart your bot:
   ```bash
   # If using PM2
   pm2 restart crypto-telegram-bot
   
   # If using systemd
   systemctl start crypto-bot
   ```

### Method 2: Automated Updates with Git

If your bot is in a git repository, you can set up automated updates:

1. Create an update script:
   ```bash
   nano /opt/telegram-crypto-bot/update.sh
   ```

2. Add the following content:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   
   # Navigate to bot directory
   cd /opt/telegram-crypto-bot
   
   # Pull latest changes
   git pull
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Update dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Restart bot
   if command -v pm2 &> /dev/null; then
       pm2 restart crypto-telegram-bot
   else
       systemctl restart crypto-bot
   fi
   ```

3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /opt/telegram-crypto-bot/update.sh
   ```

4. Set up a cron job to check for updates:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
   
   Add:
   ```
   # Check for updates every day at 3 AM
   0 3 * * * /opt/telegram-crypto-bot/update.sh >> /opt/telegram-crypto-bot/update.log 2>&1
   ```
